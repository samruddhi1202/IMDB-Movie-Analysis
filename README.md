# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
A potential question for filmmakers to investigate could be: “What factors influence the
success of a movie on IMDB?” Here, success can be defined by high IMDB ratings. The
impact of this question is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want
to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future
projects.
This project is about exploring and deriving insights from the IMDB Movie data using various data analysis techniques which will be helpful for filmmakers and other stakeholders during the production of a movie.
